    <p style="color:rgb(251, 251, 251);">Sometimes in life, being lackadaisical makes us ignorant of our potentials. <br>We actually need something to trigger us for us to realise what we carry.<br> Like a spark!<br>Then, boom, the fire begins. It 's lit.<br> But what causes the spark? <br>It
        could be a word of encouragement.<br>A word,...hmm or probably a group of words.<br>And what happens? The resound <br>They echo in your mind,...over and over again. <br> But what? <br>These words are processed, re-processed<br> Utilised again,
        recycled <br>Analysed once more Till all meaningness, sense, significance, and rapport are unveiled to the fullest. <br>And guess what? <br>This is all done in the mind! When the essence, the massage, and the spirit of these words are delivered.
        <br>Unshackled <br>This where the spark which has been caged for so long is liberatedand, set free. <br>Hmm,... Like a gas explosion, nothing can stop it until all aim is achieved. <br>And,...that is who we are!! <br>That is amazing. Very awesome.
        <br>The power of Words of Encouragement! <br>Even when we are down, as these words ring in our hearts and are reflected in the mirror of our mind, <br>The energy from the insight, the vision, the stimulus, the motivation, the boost, <br>The incitement
        and inspiration, amasses and mushrooms you back to your feet. <br>Like a revival, a restoration, a revitalization, a rebirth and an awakening that is thrilling. <br>Do you know what happens next? <br>You become unstoppable! <br>The power of Words
        of Encouragement!</p>
